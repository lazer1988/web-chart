Returning the exercise
======================

 * The deliverable for this exercise must be the zipped output of the git diff command on the repository clone that you have downloaded. 
 * Do not send back the entire exercise, just the zip archive of the diff with only your changes. 
 * Please do not post this exercise or your solution on any sites including github.



The following coding challenge is not a real world application. 
It however simulates a situation that you might experience working as a developer at deviantART. 
It is designed to test your ability to interact with legacy code and helps us get a better understanding of your development capabilities.



Instructions
============

We'd like you to enhance this web-based charting application.

 * We don't like all the whitespace. Expand the chart to fill the available
   space in the browser window.
 * Add support for our new data format (in addition to CSV). You can see an
   example of the format at http://st.deviantart.com/dt/exercise/data
 * Extend the program to accept the data file as a GET parameter. The program
   should use the appropriate Reader based on the file given and should
   gracefully handle any errors it encounters.
 * Fix all the bugs, optimize and improve everything that can be. However don't 
   rewrite the application from scratch, we want you to keep the bulk of the 
   existing code and leave the overall structure as it is.

We are unable to answer any questions about the program or these requirements.
If any of the instructions seem ambiguous, use your best judgement.

Extra Credit
============

 * Change the tooltips so that they display "N weeks ago" instead of timestamps.
 * Color any bars more than 1 standard deviation from the mean bright red.
